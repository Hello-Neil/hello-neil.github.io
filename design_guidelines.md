# Helloneil Language Learning App - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based: Duolingo-Inspired**
Primary inspiration from Duolingo's gamified learning platform, emphasizing playful engagement, clear progression, and friendly interactions. Adaptation focuses on maintaining the core motivational design patterns while creating a unique identity.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Playful Gamification**: Every interaction reinforces progress and achievement
2. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Learning interfaces prioritize comprehension
3. **Friendly Approachability**: Welcoming design that reduces learning anxiety
4. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate, clear responses to user actions

## Typography System
- **Primary Headings (H1)**: Bold, rounded sans-serif, 2.5rem-3rem desktop, 2rem mobile
- **Section Headings (H2)**: Semi-bold, 1.75rem-2rem desktop, 1.5rem mobile  
- **Lesson Titles**: Medium weight, 1.25rem-1.5rem
- **Body Text**: Regular weight, 1rem, optimized for readability
- **Buttons/CTAs**: Bold, uppercase tracking for primary actions, sentence case for secondary

## Responsive Behavior
**Mobile** (< 768px):
- Single column layouts
- Hamburger menu for navigation
- Full-width buttons
- Reduced spacing (py-12 vs py-16)
- Stacked stats display

**Desktop** (â‰¥ 768px):
- Sidebar navigation persistent
- Multi-column grids for language selection
- Larger touch targets become hover-optimized
- Increased whitespace and breathing room

**Key Breakpoints**: Use Tailwind's md: (768px) and lg: (1024px) primarily

## Accessibility
